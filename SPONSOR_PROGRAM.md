## 💪 This Changes Everything

### Before:
"AILES helps you find scholarships"
→ Commodity service, easy to copy

### After:
"AILES is a movement empowering African women through education, backed by a community of sponsors who believe in their potential"
→ Mission-driven brand, hard to replicate

**This isn't just a feature. It's a moat.** 🏆
