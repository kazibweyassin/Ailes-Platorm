## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**Craydel says:** "We help you get into universities"
**AILES says:** "We help you get FUNDED to attend universities"

This is the critical difference. In Africa, admission without funding = no education.

We're not competing with Craydel on university discovery.
**We're competing on MAKING IT AFFORDABLE.**

That's a bigger, more important problem. That's where we win.
