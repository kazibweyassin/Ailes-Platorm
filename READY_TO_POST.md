🎓 Helping African Students Access World-Class Education Opportunities

After seeing too many talented students miss out on scholarships simply because they didn't know where to look, I built Ailes Global.

The Problem:
• Students spend hours searching through scattered scholarship websites
• They miss deadlines because there's no centralized tracking
• They apply to scholarships they don't qualify for
• They give up because the process is overwhelming

The Solution:
Ailes Global is a platform that:
✅ Matches students with scholarships based on their profile (country, field of study, GPA, test scores)
✅ Tracks deadlines in one place
✅ Provides clear eligibility requirements
✅ Offers comparison tools to help students make informed decisions

We've started with 64 verified scholarships from official sources (governments, foundations, universities) and are adding more every week.

This is just the beginning. Our mission is to make world-class education accessible to every African student who dreams of studying abroad.

🚀 Excited to launch Ailes Global - a platform helping African students find scholarships that match their profile.

The challenge: Students waste time applying to scholarships they don't qualify for, or miss opportunities because they don't know they exist.

Our solution: AI-powered matching + deadline tracking + clear requirements = better outcomes.

We've started with 64 verified scholarships and are growing fast.

Would love your feedback and support! 🙏
